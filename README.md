✅ DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM

This program is a console-based Online Food Ordering System.
It allows the user to interact with a simple food menu, add items to a shopping cart, review the selected items, and finally generate a bill that includes GST.

The system uses:

A predefined menu of food items

A cart to store selected items and quantities

A menu-driven interface that keeps running until the user chooses to exit

It simulates the basic working of a food-ordering application in a simple text-based environment.

✅ INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE PROGRAM
1. Start the program

When the program begins, it repeatedly displays the main menu with five choices:

View Menu

Add Item to Cart

View Cart

Checkout

Exit

The user must enter a number (1–5) to select an option.

2. View Menu

Choosing this option will display a list of available food items along with:

Item ID

Item name

Price

This helps the user know what they can order.

3. Add Item to Cart

The user is asked to:

Enter the ID of the item

Enter the quantity they want

Once entered, the program adds that item into the cart and confirms the action.

If an invalid ID is entered, the program informs the user.

4. View Cart

This option shows all the items that the user has added.
For each item, the program displays:

The item name

Quantity selected

Total price for that item

It also calculates and shows the subtotal of the entire cart.

If the cart is empty, a message is shown instead.

5. Checkout

When the user selects checkout, the system:

Calculates the subtotal

Applies GST at 5%

Calculates the final total amount

A formatted bill is shown with all charges, and the program thanks the user.

If the cart is empty, checkout is not allowed.

6. Exit

Selecting this option stops the program and ends the application.
